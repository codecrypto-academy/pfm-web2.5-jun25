## Peer Dependencies

This SDK does not bundle `ethers`. It must be provided by the host project to avoid version conflicts and reduce package size. Ensure your project's `package.json` includes `ethers`.

**`besu-sdk/package.json`:**
```json
"peerDependencies": {
  "ethers": "^6.7.0"
}
```

A Next.js application serving as a web-based user interface to interact with a private Hyperledger Besu network deployed by the tools in this repository.

## Project Goal

This application demonstrates the final step of the project: consuming the resources of a custom-deployed blockchain. It is designed to connect to an RPC node whose connection details (URL and private key) are automatically provided by the backend deployment script (`/script/script.sh`).

## Technology Stack
-   **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
-   **UI Library**: React
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
-   **Blockchain Interaction**: Ethers.js
-   **Language**: TypeScript
-   **Local SDK**: Integrates `besu-sdk` for potential programmatic interactions.

## Getting Started

This application cannot run standalone. It requires a running Besu network deployed by the `script/` component first.

### **Step 1: Deploy the Prerequisite Network**

The deployment script is responsible for creating the blockchain and generating the necessary environment file for this application to connect to it.

1.  Navigate to the `script` directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../script
    ```

2.  Execute the deployment script:
    ```bash
    ./script.sh
    ```
3.  When the script finishes and presents its interactive menu, choose **option [2] (Stop containers but preserve configuration)**. This is critical as it leaves the generated node data and the environment file intact.

The script will create a `.env.local` file in this `frontback/` directory.

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**

Return to this directory and install the required npm packages.

```bash
cd ../frontback
npm install
```
This command also installs `besu-sdk` from the local file system, creating a symlink for seamless development.

### **Step 3: Run the Development Server**

With the network deployed and dependencies installed, you can now run the Next.js application.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Configuration

The application's connection to the blockchain is configured via the file that `sript.sh` saves (if configured to do so in its `config.yaml`) at `.env` file, which should have been automatically generated by `script.sh`. It should look like this:

**`.env`**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=http://localhost:9999
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```
-   `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL`: The JSON-RPC endpoint of a running Besu node.
-   `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of an account that was pre-funded in the genesis block, allowing the application to sign and send transactions.

## Local SDK Integration

This project uses the `besu-sdk` via a local file path dependency (`"besu-sdk": "file:../besu-sdk"`). This means any changes to the SDK's source code in the `/besu-sdk` directory will be reflected here after rebuilding the project, creating a tightly-integrated development workflow.

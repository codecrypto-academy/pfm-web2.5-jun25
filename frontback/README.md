A Next.js application serving as a web-based user interface to interact with a private Hyperledger Besu network deployed by the tools in this repository. This application demonstrates the final step of the project: consuming the resources of a custom-deployed blockchain. It is designed to connect to an RPC node whose connection details (URL and private key) are automatically provided by the backend deployment script (`/script/script.sh`).

## Features

- **Network Status**: Real-time monitoring of blockchain network status
- **Test Faucet**: Send test ETH to any address using the validator account
- **Balance Checker**: Check the ETH balance of any address
- **Transfer Panel**: Send ETH between accounts using private keys
- **Block Explorer**: View recent blocks and transactions

## Getting Started

This application cannot run standalone. It requires a running Besu network deployed by the `script/` component first.

### **Step 1: Deploy the Prerequisite Network**

The deployment script is responsible for creating the blockchain and generating the necessary environment file for this application to connect to it.

1.  Navigate to the `script` directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../script
    ```

2.  Execute the deployment script:
    ```bash
    ./script.sh
    ```

   When prompted, either choose option 1 to visualize blocks or keep it standing by so that the machines don't get turned off.

The script will create a `.env` file in this `frontback/` directory (configurable via `config.yaml` at `../script`)


### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**

Return to this directory and install the required npm packages.

```bash
cd ../frontback
npm install
```
This command also installs `besu-sdk` from the local file system, creating a symlink for seamless development.

### **Step 3: Run the Development Server**

With the network deployed and dependencies installed, you can now run the Next.js application.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Configuration

The application's connection to the blockchain is configured via the file that `sript.sh` saves (if configured to do so in its `config.yaml`) at `.env` file, which should have been automatically generated by `script.sh`. It should look like this:

**`.env`**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=http://localhost:9999
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```
-   `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL`: The JSON-RPC endpoint of a running Besu node.
-   `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of an account that was pre-funded in the genesis block, allowing the application to sign and send transactions.


## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/network/status` - Network and blockchain status
- `POST /api/faucet` - Send test ETH to an address
- `GET /api/balance?address=0x...` - Check balance of an address
- `POST /api/transfer` - Transfer ETH between accounts
- `GET /api/blocks?limit=10` - Get recent blocks


## Development

This is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) focused on functionality over aesthetics. The dashboard provides all essential features for blockchain network management and testing.

## Dependencies

- Next.js 14
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Ethers.js 6.13.0
- besu-sdk (local dependency)

## Important Notes

- This is designed for development and testing purposes only
- Private keys are handled client-side for the transfer functionality
- The faucet uses the validator account's private key from the environment
- All transactions are sent to your local Besu network
